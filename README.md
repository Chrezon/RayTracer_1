# LittleRayTracer
This is my tiny raytracer. I'm adding to this project as I learn more about rendering and raytracing in general. By the end I hope to have a fully functional (little) renderer!

#### Current Outputs: (Screenshots of the .ppm files rendered)
![Rendered Sphere](https://github.com/Chrezon/RayTracer_1/blob/master/Outputs/lamber_test.png?raw=true)

#### Current Functionality:
- [x] Camera + ray-sphere intersection
- [x] Scene object
- [x] Randomized reflection direction (lambertian reflectance)

#### Next Steps:
- [ ] Loading .obj models
- [ ] Rendering triangle meshes
- [ ] Colours
- [ ] Proper light source (not just environmental light)
- [ ] Parallelization
- [ ] Other surface materials, BDRFs??
